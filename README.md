## Purpose and Scope

The portofio project has been created as a part of the UW FSF Coding Boot Camp carriculum. It's purpose is to provide a presentatio space for future projects and my contat information. As projects are created, the links in the 'Work' Section will be updated to redirect the user to the relative project pages on Github.

## Current Build Status 

This webapage is still a work in progress. I am currently still researching how to fix the styling in my h3 and p elements in the work grid as well as applying psuedo element styling to the images. When complete the immages will funtion as links.

## CSS Elements Utilized

*Flex box
*Grid Layouto
*Links to external files
*Links to external sites
*Background image links **(still under development)**
*Psuedo Element interactivity **(still under development)**
