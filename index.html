                Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my spare time. Hegel is arguing that the reality is merely an a
                priori adjunct of non-naturalistic ethics, Kant via the categorical imperative is holding that
                ontologically it exists only in the imagination, and Marx claims it was offside. It's not pining, it's
                passed on! This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be! It's expired and gone to meet its maker! This is
                a late parrot! It's a stiff! Bereft of life, it rests in peace! If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it
                would be pushing up the daisies! It's metabolic processes are now history! He's off the twig! He's
                kicked the bucket, he's shuffled off the mortal coil, rung down the curtain and joined the choir
                invisible. This is an ex-parrot!
